# B&J-Biscuits-Sales-Dashboard 🍪

## 📌 About This Project

### Overview
This project analyzes the **sales and profit performance** of **B&J Biscuits**, a U.S.-based FMCG company.  
Using **Excel as a full analytics environment**, I transformed **raw transactional data** into **three interactive dashboards** that reveal:

- **Who buys our products** → Customer demographics & age segmentation  
- **Where revenue and profit come from** → Location, brand, and sales rep performance  
- **How our business performs over time** → Monthly, quarterly, and seasonal trends  

The dashboards are powered by **VBA macros** that allow users to:

- **Toggle between absolute values and percentages**  
- **Quickly clear filters using a slicer-reset macro**  
- **Interactively analyze sales by quarter, brand, and location**

## 📊 Dashboard 2: Profit Analysis  
🎯 **Where are we making the most money?**
![Profit_Analysis](https://github.com/Osisehh/B-and-J-Biscuit-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Dashboard%20Images/Profit%20Analysis.png)

- **Monthly Revenue Trend:**  
  - Peak in **Jan & July: $7.9M**  
  - Sudden drop **Aug–Dec: ~$3.2M/month**

- **Weekday vs Weekend Split:** **72.6% weekdays**, confirming weekday-heavy purchases  

**Key Takeaway:**  
**Q4 underperformance** is critical. Revenue collapsed after July due to either:

🎯 **How efficiently are we selling?**
![Revenue_Dynamics](https://github.com/Osisehh/B-and-J-Biscuit-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Dashboard%20Images/Revenue%20Dynamics.png)

**KPIs:**  
- Profit per Transaction: **$2.2K**  
- Revenue per Sales Rep: **$7.7M**  
- Top Sales Rep: **Travis Doyle (17.6% of revenue)**  

**Key Visuals & Insights:**  
- **Sales Rep Leaderboard:** Travis Doyle dominates; Elizabeth Guerrero lowest at 2.7%

**Key Takeaway:**  
Revenue is **heavily reliant** on premium products and **one top-performing sales rep**.  
If Travis Doyle exits or premium demand drops, **revenue risk is high**.

### **Decisions to Consider**

2. Are there **distribution gaps** in low-performing cities like Chicago?  
3. Why is **Chocolate Delight** consistently underperforming?  
4. Should we **target younger demographics** with smaller or cheaper packs?  
5. What is our **contingency plan** if Travis Doyle exits or premium demand slows?
